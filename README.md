# ðŸ”¢ Random number generator

Another generic online number generator, but with the feature to include some string before and after each number generated in the list, making the copy-and-pasting much easier.

This project was created to help me and other people that linke **minimalist** stuff and have no patience to make a command line tool, make it executable, put on the system paht, etc...
